 Picks a duty for you to run at random.

<h1>How to use/Features</h1>
You will need Java in order to use this. (Any recent version should work, nothing fancy is going on.)
Run the jarfile from the releases tab and it'll just go! 

If you have Java installed, but the jar doesn't run when you double click it, you can shift + right click in the directory the jar is in and click "Open PowerShell/CMD here" then run this command: java -jar "FFXIV Duty Roulette.jar"


<h3>Misc Stuff</h3>
This program can pick a random standard Dungeon, Trial, or Raid from one or all of the expansions. The options to include higher difficulty duties are disabled because I felt they weren't overly important and didn't want to code them just yet.

I'm open to advice on this since I'm fairly new to coding Java still, and would looooove any pointers for the interface, making them is such a pain and I have zero sense of design whatsoever.
